# Spotify Song Recommendation Algorithm and App Project - Fall 2022/Spring 2023
### Description
#### For this academic year, we will be taking on Spotify's Million Playlist Song Recommendation Challenge. This chellenge consists of 1,000,000 playlists and is aimed at allowing the end-user to enter their playlist details and have a list of recommended songs for the user to potentially add to their playlist.
### Steps
#### TO accomplish this challenge, we will complete the following tasks:
1. Create a Connection to the Spotify API.
2. Design and Implement a Data Warehouse.
3. Design and Implement an Optimized ETL Pipeline for Data Processing.
4. Load the Data into the Data Warehouse.
5. Design and Build a Machine Learning Model using Audio Analysis and Natural Language Processing (NLP) Techniques.
      * Create Training and Testing datasets for the Prediction Model using Pandas.
      * Create Streamlit App frontend to gather user input.
      * Create Streamlit App backend to connect database to the frontend.
      * Create a CI/CD pipeline between GitHub and Docker.
      * Deploy the Streamlit App using a Docker Container.
      * Extract accuracy metrics from the Decision Tree Prediction Model.
      * Create Tableau Dashboard to display the Accuracy Metrics associated with the Model.
#### To complete the above tasks, we will break into the following teams:
      * Software Engineering Team:
           - Create the API.
           - Create the Streamlit App frontend.
           - Create the CI/CD pipeline.
           - Deploy the Streamlit App.
      * Data Engineering Team:
           - Create the database.
           - Create the ELT pipeline.
           - Create Training and Testing datasets.
           - Create Streamlit App backend.
      * Data Science Team:
           - Create Decision Tree Prediction Model.
      * Data Analytics Team:
           - Extract accuracy metrics.
           - Create Tableau Dashboard.
