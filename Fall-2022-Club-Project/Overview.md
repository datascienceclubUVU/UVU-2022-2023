# Spotify Song Recommendation Algorithm and App Project - Fall 2022/Spring 2023
### Description
#### For this academic year, we will be taking on Spotify's Million Playlist Song Recommendation Challenge. This chellenge consists of 1,000,000 playlists and is aimed at allowing the end-user to enter their playlist details and have a list of recommended songs for the user to potentially add to their playlist.
### Steps
#### To accomplish this challenge, we will complete the following tasks:
1. Create a Connection to the Spotify API.
2. Design and Implement a Data Warehouse.
3. Design and Implement an Optimized ETL Pipeline for Data Processing.
4. Load the Data into the Data Warehouse.
5. Design the Front-End Web App.
6. Design and Build a Machine Learning Model using Audio Analysis and Natural Language Processing (NLP) Techniques.
7. Create Training and Testing Datasets for Our Model.
8. Create API to Allow Users to Use the App.
9. Train Our Model Using the Training Dataset.
10. Test and Validate Our Model Using the Testing Dataset.
11. Create an Event Streaming Pipeline to Gather User Engagement Data.
12. Create ETL Pipeline to Get the Event Data, Transform it to a Useful Format, and Load into the Reporting Dashboard (see Step 15).
13. Create API to Connect the Event Streaming Pipeline to Our Reporting Dashboard.
15. Create Reporting Dashboard to Visualize Our App's Engagement Metrics.
