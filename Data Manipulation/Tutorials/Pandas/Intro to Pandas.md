# Introduction to Pandas
## Description
#### Pandas is a Python library that is widely used for data analysis, manipulation, and ingestion. Built on top of the NumPy Python library, Pandas includes a multitude of methods, classes, and data structures.
## Data Types
#### Just like Python, Pandas includes a variety of data types. Listed below are some of the more widely used data types:
### String (str)
#### - This consists of a collection of letters and numbers in a textual numbers.
      - Example: "This is a string!"
      - Example: "125 days since last accident."
### Integer (int)
#### - This is a whole number with no decimal points.
      - Example: 25
### Float (float)
#### - This is a number with x number of decimal places.
      - Example: 5.255
      - Example: 2.5
### Boolean (bool)
#### - This is a True or False statement.
      - Example: True
      - Example: False
## Data Structures
#### Also like Python, Pandas includes a variety of data structures, including dome of its own. Listed below are some commonly used data structures:
### List
#### - This consists of an assorted catalog of items with the SAME data type. The items in a list can be changed later in the program.
      - Example: ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Orange']
      - Example: [5, 7, 85]
### Tuple
#### - This is the same as a list, except the values in the tuple CAN'T be changed later in the program.
      - Example: ('apple', 'banana', 'orange')
### Dictionary
#### - This is a list of values identified by a key value. These are used when creating Dataframes (see below).
      - Example: {'Apples': 55, 'Bananas': 30, 'Oranges': 20}
### Series
#### - This is a one-dimensional data structure that is formed in the shape of a vertical list or column.
      - Example: 'Apple'
                 'Banana'
                 'Orange'
### DataFrame
#### - This is a two-dimensional data structure that is formed in the shape of a basic table. These can include indexes to reference specific items (shown below in the brackets). These are the most common data structure used in Pandas.
      - Example: 'Store'  'Apples' 'Bananas' 'Oranges'
            [0]  'Orem'   55       30        20
            [1]  'Provo'  30       55        20
            [2]  'Lindon' 20       30        55
