          - name: avg_danceability
            description: average score for the danceability measure. "Danceability" describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.

            description: average score for the energy measure. "Energy" represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity.
          - name: avg_loudness
            description: average score for the loudness measure. "Loduness" is measured by the overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude).
          - name: avg_acousticness_probability
            description: average probability that the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.
          - name: avg_speechiness_probability
            description: average probability that the track has lyrics. "Speechiness" detects the presence of spoken words in a track. Values closer to 1.0 represent high condifence the track has lyrics.
          - name: most_common_key
            description: the most common key found in each playlist. Integers map to pitches using standard Pitch Class notation. E.g. 0 = C, 1 = C♯/D♭, 2 = D, and so on. If no key was detected, the value is -1.
          - name: most_common_mode
            description: the most common mode found in each playlist. Mode indicates the modality (major or minor) of a track, the type of scale from which its melodic content is derived. Major is represented by 1 and minor is 0.
          - name: avg_liveness_probability
            description: average probability that the track was performed live. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live.
          - name: avg_valence
            description: average score for the valence measure. "Valence" is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive.
          - name: avg_tempo
            description: average score for the tempo measure. Tempo is more commonly referred to as "BPM" (Beats per Minute).
